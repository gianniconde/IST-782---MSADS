## Description
The Applied Data Science Mastersâ€™s Degree program at Syracuse University supplies students with the expertise necessary to thrive in the analytically driven realm of data science. The emergence of various areas of study in the data science field led the program to design tracks to accommodate those pursuing careers in Artificial Intelligence, Business Analytics, Data Pipelines and Platforms, Language Analytics, Project Management, and Visual Analytics. <br>
The expertise that this program bestows onto their successful students include:
- Data collection, storage, and accessibility through identification and leveraging of applicable technologies.
- Create obtainable insight from data pertaining to various industries while utilizing the full data science life cycle.
- Generate actionable insight with the application of predictive models and visualizations.
- Efficient use of programming languages such as Python, R, SQL, etc.
- Communication of analytical insights and visualizations to a broad range of stakeholders.
- Ethical development, use, and evaluation of data and models to ensure fairness, privacy, and bias. <br>

These acquired skills are evident in the various projects that I have completed throughout the span of the program, particularly in courses such as IST 659: Data Administration Concepts & Database Management, IST 707: Applied Machine Learning, and IST 736: Text Mining. <br>
